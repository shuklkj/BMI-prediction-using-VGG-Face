Real-Time BMI Estimation using Computer Vision and Deep Learning: A Web API Approach for Facial Image Analysis


Obesity is a prevalent public health issue with significant implications for chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. Monitoring Body Mass Index (BMI) is a valuable indicator of overall health and fitness. However, conventional BMI measurement methods often prove incon- venient or require specialized equipment, hindering widespread adoption and regular monitoring. To address this challenge, we aim to develop a web API that leverages computer vision techniques to predict BMI in real-time using facial images. By harnessing the power of computer vision and deep learning, our solution aims to provide an efficient and practical tool for BMI estimation, enabling personalized health monitoring for developers and end-users alike. The problem we aim to solve is the inconvenience and lack of accessibility associ- ated with conventional BMI measurement methods. Current approaches, such as using scales or specialized equipment, can be cumbersome, time-consuming, and may not be readily available to everyone. Additionally, these methods of- ten require individuals to disrobe or provide personal information, which may deter some users from regular monitoring. Our goal is to overcome these limi- tations by developing a web API that allows users to estimate their BMI using
facial images. By providing the option to upload static facial images or cap- ture real-time images through a webcam, we eliminate the need for specialized equipment and simplify the process for users. The web API empowers devel- opers and end-users to integrate BMI prediction functionality and personalized health monitoring seamlessly.
